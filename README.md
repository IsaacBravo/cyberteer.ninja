# Welcome to cyberteer.ninja!

The website (https://cyberteer.ninja/) is an academic introduction into the reasons and methods behind outsourcing of state policy goals to non-state actors in the cyberspace. 
It is meant to serve as a good starting point for all researchers who would like to understand the subject of cyber non-state actors better. It also fulfills the role of a clearing house for much of the existing research on the topic that can be accessed online. The website content is also available in PDF eBook format.
What can you find in this repository?

1. Our own research based on more than 300 book chapters and articles, which is detailed in our free E-Book.
2. Audio and video excerpts from interviews with experts in the field.
3. The source code in R with the implementation of text analysis and various visualisations such as word clouds, network graphs, and world map. 

We believe that our methodology should be open to all who would like to create a similar introduction into a topic of their own.
The group project is the result of a collaborative effort of 5 master's students, in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the "Introduction to Politics, Technology and Sustainability" class at the Bavarian School of Public Policy, Technical University of Munich.
